# Project Name
> Skin Cancer(Melanoma) Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)


## General Information
Problem Statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- The Model created without Data treatment had very poor Accuracy.
- We had treat the Data for overfit and class imbalance.
- In the final model, we used 30 epochs to get Accuracy of 90%.
- The computation dependency was way high, we had to Colab from Google to make models.
